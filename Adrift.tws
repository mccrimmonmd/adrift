You hear the sound of <<if $cold>>running<<else>>splashing<<endif>> water coming from the pit, but you can't quite see in.\u000a\u000aOn the other wall of the room, barely visible through the steam, is a narrow hall with a flight of stairs climbing out of sight.

VIt takes some time to cross the maze.  For every wall you can simply climb over, four more block your way, and although the walls are clear glass, the shimmering water running over them makes it impossible to see the path beyond.\u000a\u000aAt last, you find your way to the other side of the maze, where a narrow walkway extends to a broad sheet of falling water.  On the other side of the waterfall, you see that the hazy shape from before is actually two people, sitting close together--talking, perhaps, though you can't hear anything through the water.\u000a\u000aYou start to make your way across, but your once-sure footing is suddenly gone, leaving the watery glass slick and smooth.  Below the walkway, you can see all the way to the bottom of the pool, hundreds of feet down.\u000a\u000a[[keep going|WalkwayCross]]\u000a[[turn back|MiddleStairs][$from = "people"]]

Along the edge of the room is a cozy-looking ledge for sitting, with glass walls on each side, and the interior is scattered with plush, colorful cushions and pillows.  Across from the entrance is a narrow hall leading to another room, identical to the one you're in except for its spectacular view of the green, breezy forest far below.\u000a\u000a<<if $cold>>You suddenly notice that your entrance has left you soaking wet from head to toe, and as the water slowly drips off your naked body it takes the warmth of the stairways with it.

VYou wait at the top of the ladder and listen to the <<$boy>>s' conversation.  Their murmurs and whispers are too faint to make out words, but you can hear well enough to sense their intimacy. Every few minutes there's a faint rustling of clothes, or a whisper of skin.\u000a\u000aAs your eyes adjust to the darkness, you notice stars glowing faintly on the ceiling.\u000a\u000a[[keep listening|LoftToStars]]\u000a[[leave|House]]

Beyond the glass lies the forest. \u000a\u000aThe wall opposite the entrance is also glass. There's a smooth tan beach and calm waves on the other side.
